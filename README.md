# Stellaris Flowchart

This app allows to model a supply chain in Stellaris economy and compute output and upkeeps for them.

The project is a single-page [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app that heavily relies on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## Graph

I made graph's nodes draggable so you can rearrange them the way you like. As I still try to figure out how to make it [planar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph) and render it nicely 

## Jobs

There are manifold jobs available in Stellaris. As of now, basic jobs available to biological non-hivemind empires are present as well as catalytic technicians (civic `Catalytic Process`) and anglers and pearl divers (civic `Anglers`). I will add more jobs in the future.

## Resources

Three basic resources: food, minerals, and energy, and two advanced: consumer goods and alloyws are available as well. 

## Output and upkeeps

At the moment, output and upkeeps are not scaled with habitability modifiers. Nevertheless, I will add them later as well as living standard upkeeps.
